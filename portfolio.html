      <h3>Web Site for an Old Age Home</h3>
      <p>
        This project involved creating a website for an Old Age Home, aiming to provide information about the facilities and services offered by the organization.

      <h3>Web Application for Chemistry Laboratory Management</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I developed a web application to manage the operations of a Chemistry Laboratory. The application allowed users to log in and access different functionalities based on their roles (e.g., students, lab assistants, and faculty). It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL for database management.
